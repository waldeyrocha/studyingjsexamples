This project represents a simple web page that calculates the area of a trapezoid and demonstrates various JavaScript functionalities. It includes an HTML file, CSS styles, and JavaScript code.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the following elements:

- A heading (`<h1>`) displaying "Area del Trapecio"
- A form with input fields for the base lengths and height of the trapezoid
- A button to calculate the area of the trapezoid (`<button onclick="areaTrapecio()">Resultado</button>`)
- A paragraph (`<p>`) element to display the result (`<p id="resultado"></p>`)
- A paragraph with hidden content and a button to show the hidden content when clicked (`<p><span id="vermas">...</span></p>`)
- An image element that triggers a function to display a hidden menu when clicked (`<img src="..." alt="..." width="104" height="142" id="menu" onclick="hiddenMenu()">`)
- A navigation menu (`<nav>`) containing links to different pages (`<ul>` and `<li>` elements)

## CSS Styles

The CSS styles in the `<style>` block define the appearance of various elements on the web page. They include styles for the body, headings, buttons, forms, inputs, and more. Additionally, there are specific styles for certain classes and IDs used in the HTML file.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code is included in a separate file (`codigo.js`). It provides the following functionality:

- A function to calculate the area of a trapezoid based on user input (`areaTrapecio()`)
- A function to toggle the visibility of hidden content when a button is clicked (`esconder()`)
- A function to display a hidden menu when the image is clicked (`hiddenMenu()`)
- A function to calculate the average test scores of two students and display their results and pass/fail status (`mediaTest()`)

## Additional Files

The project includes the following additional JavaScript file:

- `actividad.js`: This file contains an example code snippet that calculates the average test scores of two students and displays their results.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can interact with the form to calculate the area of a trapezoid and explore the various JavaScript functionalities demonstrated on the page.

Feel free to modify the code and customize it according to your needs!
